            <p><h3> Beat Detection for Automated Music Transcription: An Exploration of Onset Detection Algorithms.</h3> </p>
            <h3> Context: </h3>
            <p>
              This was completed as the project requirement for my Masters in Electrical Engineering. This was a solo project under the advisement of <a href="http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fowler/">Dr. Mark Fowler</a> 
            </p>
            <h3> Abstract/Summart: </h3>
            <p> This project attempts to answer part of the question: Can music be reconstructed into sheet music from a recording through signal processing? This is a multifaceted problem that entails instrument identification, instrument isolation, pitch detection, dynamics etc. This project will explore a subset of this area, i.e., the fascinating world of beat detection, more commonly called onset detection.</p>
            <p>While there are many methods that can isolate onsets, this project focuses only on frequency domain detection functions. There is, however, some discussion of time domain methods to give a taste of insight to frequency domain methods. The discussion is concluded with the results of several onset detection algorithms to give an empirical comparison between algorithms.</p>
