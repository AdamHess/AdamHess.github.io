            <p>
              This project was completed as a part of a course on Ethnomusicology. This solo project's goal was to select a music tradition and disuss it at length. This paper discusses the perspectives of what goes on in college a cappella groups focusing on the Binghamton Treblemakers, an alternative rock group which I was a member of for some time.
