            <h3> Context: </h3>
            <p>
              These pieces were arranged as a part of my Choral Arranging Class taught by <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/music/faculty/bborton.html">Dr. Bruce Borton</a>  These were all solo written works with the goal of taking existing pieces and arranging them for a choire.
            </p>
            <h3>Abstract/Summary: </h3>
            <p>
              There were three requirements for the sum of the works:
            </p>
            <p>
              One had to have accompaniment.
              One had to be written for SSA.
              Two different styles of music needed to be represented.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Black is the Color" is  scored for SSA and has accompaniment.</br>
              "Bright is the Ring of Words"  is a classical work.</br>
              "Sound of Silence" is a pop work.
