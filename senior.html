	      <p> <h3> Feedback Controller for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Microphone</h3></p>
		<p>
A MEMS microphone was developed by Dr. Ron Miles of Binghamton University. The microphone is modeled after the ears of the <i>Ormia ochracea</i> fly which will allow a micro-scale microphone to not only detect sound pressure, but the direction which the sound is coming from.The benefit of this tiny microphone is that it has a very low noise floor meaning it is very sensitive to sound. The microphone, however, has a resonant peak in its freqency response. It sounds as if someone were talking down a tube or tunnel with a stuffy nose. The goal of the project was to design a feedback controller that would reduce or eliminate the resonant peak. 

 <p>The papers describe the design process used to develop and implement the feedback controller. While involved in most aspects of the project, my major contribution was analyzing the effects of electronic noise and non-ideal properties of operational amplifiers.

<p> There are two different papers and presentations documenting the progress of the project. The fall paper focuses on the design of the project while the spring paper focuses on the implementation and testing of the designs.</p>
